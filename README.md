## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/3JFYedSOZqAxYuOCNmYD) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## How To Use
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/jcom-dev/windbnb

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ ng serve
```
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
